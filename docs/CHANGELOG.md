# CLIENTFACTORY - CHANGELOG

## [0.9.28] -- *2025-06-29*
* Bulk Operations Mixin: Foundation for multi-request coordination with dependency resolution
+ BulkMixin Implementation: Core functionality for batching and orchestrating multiple requests
- Request collection and identification using hash-based IDs for reliable tracking

- Response aggregation modes: all, first, last, success, failure, count
- Transaction rollback support with custom rollback hooks for sequential operations
- Builder pattern configuration API for fluent bulk operation setup
- Support for both RequestModel and ExecutableRequest objects in bulk operations
+ Enhanced Request Models: Hash and equality support for reliable request identification

- Added toexecutable() convenience method for RequestModel to ExecutableRequest conversion
- Hash-based request identification ensures reliable dependency tracking and response collection
+ Bulk Operation Features: Comprehensive configuration and execution control

- Flexible error handling with built-in handlers (RAISE, BREAK, CONTINUE) and custom callbacks
- Response collection with selective aggregation and error tracking
- Execution delays for rate limiting and performance tuning
- Thread pool configuration for parallel execution scenarios

**Deferred Features**: Advanced capabilities postponed for future implementation
- Parallel execution with dependency support (complex coordination required)

- Basic aggregation modes only - no custom transformation pipelines
- Request configuration handled at request object level rather than bulk operation level

**Developer Experience**: Foundation established for complex request orchestration workflows with room for architectural refinement in future releases
